<Section label="CONTEXT" title="Where the River Stalled">
<TwoColumn>
  <div slot="left">
    Direct Sales Agents (DSAs) were the bridge between customers and home loans.
    But friction had built up at every turn—repetitive data entry, confusing settlement
    calculations, and a flow that demanded expertise rather than supported it.

    I was brought in to redesign the core loan origination experience.

  </div>
  <Callout slot="right" title="Business Impact">
    - High drop-off rates at application stage
    - 40% of agent time spent on repetitive data entry
    - Customer complaints about slow processing
  </Callout>
</TwoColumn>
</Section>

<Section label="RESEARCH" title="Mapping the Currents">
  Conducted field research with 15 DSAs across 4 cities, observing their daily
  workflows and pain points. The findings revealed friction at every step of the
  loan journey.
</Section>

<PullQuote>
  Each observation felt like tracing a tributary—understanding how effort
  fragmented before it reached momentum.

<Section label="SOLUTION" title="Re-engineering the Flow">
<PhaseBlock phase="1" title="Structured Settlement by State">
  Redesigned the settlement calculator with state-specific logic, eliminating the need
  for agents to manually reference policy documents. The system now surfaces the right
  fields automatically based on loan type and location.
</PhaseBlock>

<PhaseBlock phase="2" title="Progressive Simplification">
  Introduced a step-by-step flow that reveals complexity only when needed.
  Advanced options are tucked away for experts, while the default path guides
  new agents through the process.
</PhaseBlock>

<PhaseBlock phase="3" title="Smart Defaults">
  Analyzed thousands of past applications to identify patterns. Common values are now
  pre-filled, and the system learns from each agent's preferences over time.
</PhaseBlock>
</Section>

<PullQuote>Every 5 minutes saved meant 5 more customers served.</PullQuote>

<Section label="REFLECTION" title="The Quiet Power of Alignment">
  What started as a usability problem revealed itself as an alignment challenge.
  The old flow assumed expertise; the new flow builds it. By meeting agents
  where they are, we made the complex feel simple—and that simplicity compounds
  with every interaction.
