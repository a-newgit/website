Research synthesis is where insights are won or lost. Raw data is just noise until you find the signal.

## The temptation of premature patterns

When you've conducted 15 interviews, your brain starts seeing patterns everywhere. Some are real. Most are coincidence dressed up as insight. The discipline is in waiting—collecting enough data before drawing conclusions.

## Affinity diagrams work (but not how you think)

The value of affinity diagramming isn't the final groupings. It's the conversation that happens while grouping. When done collaboratively, it surfaces assumptions and builds shared understanding.

## Quote banking saves future you

Every research project, I maintain a running document of notable quotes with minimal context. These become invaluable when presenting findings, writing case studies, or revisiting decisions months later.

## Synthesis is translation

Your job isn't just to understand what users said. It's to translate their experiences into language and frameworks that stakeholders can act on. This is a creative act, not a mechanical one.

## The insight hierarchy

Not all insights are equal. I find it useful to categorize:

1. **Observations**: What we saw/heard (factual, specific)
2. **Patterns**: Recurring observations across participants
3. **Insights**: What the patterns mean (interpretation)
4. **Implications**: What we should do about it (action)

Stakeholders often jump to implications. Your job is to show your work—to make the path from observation to action traceable.
